ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received:', data.type, data);
};
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'subscribe',
  data: { event_types: ['stream_event', 'progress', 'connection'] }
}));
```

### 2. Step Tracking Integration (`step_tracking_integration.go`)

Demonstrates integration between step tracking and the enhanced features:

- **Multi-Step Operations**: Complex deployment workflow with 8 steps

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### Dependencies
```bash
go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
```

### File Permissions
The examples create files in the current directory:
- `./demo_output.txt` - Enhanced copy output

## 🧪 Testing Integration

### Unit Testing Support
The enhanced features include comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
# Test file transfer progress
go test ./pkg/connection -v -run TestLocalConnection_CopyWithProgress

# Test WebSocket streaming
go test ./pkg/websocket -v

# Test logging integration
go test ./pkg/logging -v

# Test enhanced copy module
go test ./pkg/modules -v -run TestEnhancedCopyModule
```

### Memory Logging for Tests
```go
logger := logging.NewStreamLogger("test", "session")
memOutput := logger.AddMemoryOutput(100)

// Run operations...

entries := memOutput.GetEntries()
// Validate log entries in tests
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### File Transfer Progress
