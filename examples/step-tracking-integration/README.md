# Step Tracking Integration Demo

This example demonstrates how the enhanced features integrate with gosinble's step tracking system for complex multi-step operations.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Multi-Step Operations**: Complex deployment workflow with 8 steps
- **Step Lifecycle Tracking**: Start, progress, and completion events
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time step updates for web dashboards
- **Logging Integration**: Comprehensive step logging with metadata
- **Progress Visualization**: Overall and per-step progress tracking

## Running the Demo

```bash
go run examples/step-tracking-integration/main.go
```

## Deployment Steps Simulated

1. **Validate Environment** - Check system requirements (2s)
2. **Backup Current Version** - Create backup of existing app (3s)
3. **Download Package** - Download new application version (5s)
4. **Extract Files** - Extract application files (2s)
5. **Configure Application** - Update configuration files (3s)
6. **Set Permissions** - Set proper file permissions (1s)
7. **Start Services** - Start application services (2s)
8. **Health Check** - Verify application is running (3s)

## Expected Output
